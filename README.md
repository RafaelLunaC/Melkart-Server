# Melkart-Server

Welcome to the Melkart Server files repo. Here you can find all the necessary files and other info to set up your server.

## 1. Installation Basics

- Put @Melkart folder in your server root.
- Copy the "ralukas.bikey" in your server "keys" folder.
- Download the mission files and put them on your server

##Beta-Warning

The mission files are still on very early stages, i'm currently working the economy so i will post updates soon. I'll also release the Central Economy files in case someone wants to collaborate with the project or make modifications for their server
