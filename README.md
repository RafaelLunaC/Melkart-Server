# MELKART BETA SERVER FILES

Welcome to the Melkart Server Files Repo. Here you will find all the necessary files and related info to set up your Dayz server using Melkart.

## BETA-WARNING

The mission files are still early in development. Spawn values of items have been configured taking into account the size of the map and the number of avaiable points, but these values will be balanced as in-game tests are carried out.

* Mission files now avaiable for supporters on Discord. 
*Economy Editor Files now avaiable for supporters on Discord.

##  INSTALLATION GUIDE

- Add @Melkart_beta to your server root, and remember adding the mod to your command line.
- Copy ralukas.bikey from the mod keys folder to your server root keys folder
- Download the mission files and copy them inside your mpmissions folder
- Replace the the mission files parameter in your serverDZ.cfg

## NOTES
- Spawn points are set only for events that are enabled by default, so be careful if you enable other events as they won't work properly.
- Be careful when increasing the number of items since the map size and the amount of available points is far lower than Chernarus and this could affect server performance.
- ContaminatedAreas are disabled by default, this can be modified in future versions depending on how the map design progresses. Of course the servers owners can modify it and contaminate any part of the map.
