#1.05 BETA PATCH NOTES

-Full types.xml update, all objects added to match the current Dayz 1.20 Patch.
-Changes to the spawn values of several items to make the loot more balanced.
-New Static Contaminated Areas: Just like in other maps, Melkart will have two contaminated areas which will be important not only to find certain weapons but also key items to access other areas that you will discover in the new update.
-Active NBC items: Derived from the above, all objects related to contaminated areas are avaiable.

# MELKART BETA SERVER FILES

Welcome to the Melkart Server Files Repo. Here you will find all the necessary files and related info to set up your Dayz server using Melkart.

## BETA-WARNING

The mission files are still early in development. Spawn values of items have been configured taking into account the size of the map and the number of avaiable points, but these values will be balanced as in-game tests are carried out.

##  INSTALLATION GUIDE

- Add @Melkart_beta to your server root, and remember adding the mod to your command line.
- Copy ralukas.bikey from the mod keys folder to your server root keys folder
- Download the mission files and copy them inside your mpmissions folder
- Replace the the mission files parameter in your serverDZ.cfg

## NOTES
- Spawn points are set only for events that are enabled by default, so be careful if you enable other events as they won't work properly.
- Be careful when increasing the number of items since the map size and the amount of available points is far lower than Chernarus and this could affect server performance.


Downloading and repacking this mod or its content is not allowed. Use Steam Workshop collections!

Remember to use the full version of the mission files, you have to unzip the .rar file, the version in the folder does not include the areaflags.map file due to Github file size limit
